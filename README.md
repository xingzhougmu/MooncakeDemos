# MooncakeDemos
## Motivation
In [Azure Public Document](https://www.azure.cn/), we have code snipplet for every service. However, it is quite common that the code cannot be simply copied to your project and make it work.

This project aims to provide runnable demos for all existing azure services and they will be written in many popular programming languages including C#, JAVA, Python, Node.JS, PHP and so on.
